Still **work in progress**.

## How to Build

In order to build and compile, you need to install `Make` plus the toolchain of your choice, e.g. `g++` or `clang`. After you setup `Make` with your toolchain of choice, clone the repository and build the project as follows:

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/joseph.vanlierop/cpsc-411.git
cd cpsc-411/
make
```

## How to Run

```shell
$ golf [filename]
```
